# 3.cpp
3. When is a graph a tree? Write a program that will read from a file 
specified on the command line and determine from the graph's adjacency 
matrix whether or not it is a tree. 

Example:

./a.out graph.txt

Output:

The graph is a tree!

Contents of graph.txt will be something like this:

5
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0

To be graded, your program must be in your pgm
and named precisely as 3.cpp.
